## Usage
- **Accessibility -** Make music accessible to people with low musicality or hearing loss
- Present music visually breaking down to different dimensions, helpful for:
	- **Comparative Analysis -** comparing music genres (subgenres), historical periods, instruments, and performances visually
	- **Music History Timeline -** interactive timeline to explore the development of music over time, aiding in studying music history.
	- **Cross-Art Connections -** creating connections among different art styles (Ella's both photographer and DJ)
- Well U need to party before & after or even during studying XD


## What we learnt
- C++
- how to flash from ARM chip mac to arduino

## Log
*Starting time: 2024-04-05 7.30pm*
- Brainstorm & Init structure set up - *1h in*

### Ella (saprobeat)
- Cpp compile & flash onto uno using platformio (pio) 	- *8h in*
- Midi -> 4D array										- *9h in*
- Live BPM detect										- *15h in*
- Set up MIDI circuit
- All above features tested

### Jack (astilbeat)


## Known issues/ concerns
- passing 4D array (channel, duration, volume, pitch) might introduce competing issue [multi threads]
- We might want seperate midis for music & environment - BPM read off env would be noisy


## Special thx to
- Suppliers to hardwares (RGB light, arduino, sound sensors) tha may or may not be present
